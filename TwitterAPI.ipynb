    "## Python Twitter API\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an introduction workshop to APIs. Specifically, we will be using the python API for various applications\n",
    "\n",
    "*The following is taken from [Stack Abuse](https://stackabuse.com/accessing-the-twitter-api-with-python/)*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many APIs on the Twitter platform that software developers can engage with, with the possibility to create fully automated systems which will innteract with Twitter. While this feature could benefit companies by drawing insights from Twitter data, it is also suitable for smaller-scale projects, research, and fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Credentials (API Key)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using the Twitter API, you first need a Twitter account. If you have not registered for a Twitter account, sign up for one [here](https://twitter.com/home). The process of getting credentials actively changes over time but currently (as of 10/2/2019) it is currently as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visit the Application Management page at https://apps.twitter.com/, and sign in with your Twitter account\n",
    "- Click on the \"Create New App\" button, fill in the details and agree the Terms of Service. This might take time to become \"verified\" by Twitter!\n",
    "- Navigate to \"Keys and Access Tokens\" section and take a note of your Consumer Key and Secret\n",
    "- In the same section click on \"Create my access token\" button\n",
    "- Take note of your Access Token, Access Token Secret, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's all. The consumer key/secret is used to authenticate the app that is using the Twitter API, while the access token/secret authenticates the user. All of these parameters should be treated as passwords, and should not be included in your code in plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Wrappers for Twitter\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps \"wrapper\" is a better term for how to describe Twitter's python API, because the following examples are using python specific libraries to create code to \"wrap\" around the API to do various things. I will give examples with a couple libraries I have used, though there are many more. Don't hesitate to use another one you already know and like better than these. The two we will be using in this notebook are Twython and Tweepy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "*Workshop Attendees*\n",
    "I'm using this code in several environments. One is for hands-on workshops where the notebook will be hosted on the Rivanna Cluster (UVA's high performance computing cluster). Workshop attendees will basically be running this notebook in a virtual environment hosted on Rivanna. We are doing it this way because everyone has a different system so we are using Rivanna so everyone has the same environment, with the same libraries installed. This way we can focus on the code and the concepts without running into technical roadblocks while getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "*On Your Own*\n",
    "I have also made this code available as a .py file, as well as this jupyter notebook, in a [github repository](https://github.com/epurpur/pythonAPI). You are free to use it as you like. However you'll need to install some of these packages yourself using pip or another package manager (conda for example). In the code, I've noted where you'll need to install these things yourself. \n",
