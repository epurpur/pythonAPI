    "## Get API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is get an API key. To do that, go [here](https://openweathermap.org/api) and sign up. It should only take a few minutes to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, scroll down and you see that OpenWeatherMap provides different subscription levels which provide different data. The free API key allows you access to today's weather and the 5 day forcast, among other things. This is what we will be working with today. \n",

    "OpenWeatherMap provides really nice documentation for how to submit requests using Python \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is install the 'requests' library. Requests is one of many libraries available that someone out there wrote and published for the world to use. We need to use a package manager called conda to install this. "
